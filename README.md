# DataStructures
Coding practice for most common data strucutures

First, the absolute must-haves, in order:
1. Trees (especially Binary Search Trees)
2. Trees (especially Binary Search Trees) - again
3. Big O Notation
4. Hash Tables
5. Object Oriented Design/System Design
6. Algorithms: Breadth First Search/Depth First Search, Binary Search, Merge Sort and Quick Sort

So what's left? Again, in order of priority:
1. Arrays
2. Recursion
3. Linked Lists
4. Stacks/Queues
5. Bit Manipulation
