# DataStructures
Coding practice for most common data strucutures

First, the absolute must-haves, in order:
* Trees (especially Binary Search Trees)
* Trees (especially Binary Search Trees) - again
* Big O Notation
* Hash Tables
* Object Oriented Design/System Design
* Algorithms: Breadth First Search/Depth First Search, Binary Search, Merge Sort and Quick Sort

So what's left? Again, in order of priority:
* Arrays
* Recursion
* Linked Lists
* Stacks/Queues
* Bit Manipulation
